(Tell us what your idea is) IDEA: This Application is useful for deaf people.
                                  The data is stored in firebase cloud and if we want to add some new action with name then we can add through this application.
                                  We can use deep machine learning for detecting the action by using TensorFlow.
                                  This application is also useful for different application like Whatsapp,Instagram,Google Hangouts,etc..
                                  They can easily communicate with each other by using this application.
                                 
                                 
(Tell us how you plan on bringing it to life) PLAN: 1) Current application detecting the diffrent objects.
                                                    2)Next plan: 1)Detecting human action =>(Work in progress) Requried Library which detect human action and show exaction action in words/setences.
